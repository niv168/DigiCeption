                Here are some key points to help you spot phishing attempts:

                - Check the Sender's Email Address: Examine the sender's email address closely. Phishing emails often use slightly altered or fake email addresses that mimic legitimate ones.
                  Look for misspellings or unusual domain names.
                - Watch for Urgent or Threatening Language: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency or fear to prompt quick action.
                  Be skeptical of emails that threaten dire consequences if you don't respond immediately.
                - Inspect URLs Carefully: Hover your mouse pointer over any links in the email without clicking on them. Check if the URL displayed matches the website it claims to be.
                  Be cautious of URLs with misspelled domain names or extra characters.  
                - Check for Spelling and Grammar Mistakes: Phishing emails often contain noticeable spelling and grammatical errors.
                  Professional organizations typically proofread their messages.
